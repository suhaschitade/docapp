- [x] **User Experience** - Cleaner, more focused patient search results

#### **Technical Implementation Details**
```typescript
// Updated API signature
getPatientOptions(search?: string, assignedDoctorId?: string): Promise<PatientOption[]>

// PatientSearch component now accepts:
interface PatientSearchProps {
  // ... existing props
  doctorId?: string; // New prop for filtering
}

// Appointments page passes doctor context:
<PatientSearch doctorId={selectedDoctor} ... />
```

#### **Files Modified**
- `backend/Controllers/PatientsController.cs` - Enhanced search endpoint
- `frontend/src/lib/api/patients.ts` - Updated API client methods
